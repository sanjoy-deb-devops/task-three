Kubernetes supports the microservices architecture by dynamically allocating resources when system demands increase. Therefore, organizations need not pay for resources that are not used.We can host the microservice application in the local platform such as in VMWare, where they provide an integrated console for Kubernetes clusters. Kubernetes cluster can be deployed from infrastructure as code software tools like ansible, and terraform which reduce the deployment time and complexity. Application will be hosted under network load balancing and multiple pods which will help to balance the traffic within the pods. If any pod dies, with the help of load balance traffic will be distribute to other pods. Moreover, under kubernetes cluster pods regenerate upon dying. Monitoring tool such as kibana and prometheus should be implemented for the routine inspection of the clusters resources
